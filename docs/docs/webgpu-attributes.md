# Per-Gaussian attributes (WebGPU)

Besides centre, scales, rotation, colour and spherical harmonics, splats can carry any number of extra **attributes**: a normal, a semantic label, an id, a feature vector. Each attribute has a name, a storage format and a number of components. Attributes load from PLY and `.rad` files, survive LoD building with a merge rule of your choice, and can be read by any Slang kernel and shown or picked in the WebGPU draw.

The code is in `src/webgpu/attributes/` (TypeScript), `slang/core/attrib.slang` (decoding on the GPU) and `rust/spark-lib/src/attrib.rs` (LoD merging and `.rad` chunks). `examples/webgpu/attributes.html` shows all of it.

## The schema

An attribute is described by an `AttributeSpec`:

```typescript
interface AttributeSpec {
  name: string;
  format: AttribFormat;   // "f32" | "f16" | "unorm8" | "snorm8" | "u8" | "u16" | "u32"
  components: number;     // 1 or more
  lodMerge?: LodMerge;    // "weightedMean" | "normalizeMean" | "max" | "mode" | "first"
  toDraw?: boolean;       // readable in the draw shaders
  direction?: boolean;    // a 3-vector that turns with its object (normals)
}
```

### Formats

| Format | Bytes per component | Values you write | Value read in Slang |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| `f32` | 4 | any float | the float |
| `f16` | 2 | any float | the float, at half precision |
| `unorm8` | 1 | `[0, 1]` | `[0, 1]` in steps of 1/255 |
| `snorm8` | 1 | `[-1, 1]` | `[-1, 1]` in steps of 1/127 |
| `u8` | 1 | integers `0..255` | the integer |
| `u16` | 2 | integers `0..65535` | the integer |
| `u32` | 4 | integers | the integer |

Components are packed little-endian at their format's size, and each attribute starts on a word boundary. `snorm8 × 3` is a compact normal, `u8` or `u16` a label, `f16 × 8` a feature vector.

### Setting attributes

Attributes of a set of splats live in an `AttribPool`, one column per attribute, where index `i` is splat `i`. On a `GpuSplatSource` (the GPU copy of a PackedSplats or ExtSplats), `setAttribute` creates the pool if needed:

```typescript
source.setAttribute("normal", normals, "snorm8", 3, { toDraw: true, direction: true });
source.setAttribute("label", labels, "u8", 1, { toDraw: true });
source.setAttribute("feature", features, "f16", 8, { toDraw: true });

source.attribs.getAttribute("label", 42); // [3]
```

`data` holds `count × components` values. When `format` is left out it follows the array type, and `lodMerge` defaults to `normalizeMean` for directions, `mode` for the integer formats and `weightedMean` otherwise. `setAttribute` bumps the source's version, so the renderer regenerates; after changing an `AttribPool` directly, call the renderer's `markDirty()`.

## Loading from files

### PLY

A binary PLY's vertex properties that Spark doesn't use for the splat itself (anything other than position, colour, opacity, scale, rotation, `f_dc_*` and `f_rest_*`) become attributes:

- `nx`, `ny`, `nz` become `normal`, a 3-component direction. An all-zero normal is dropped: 3DGS trainers write `nx = ny = nz = 0`.
- `name_0`, `name_1`, ... of one type become `name` with that many components.
- Anything else becomes an attribute of its own, with one component.

Unsigned integer properties keep their size (`uchar` → `u8`, `ushort` → `u16`, `uint` → `u32`); everything else is stored as `f32`. All PLY attributes are `toDraw`.

```typescript
const packed = new PackedSplats({ url: "scene.ply" });
await packed.initialized;
packed.extra.attribs;   // the attributes (AttribPool.from() restores its methods)
const source = GpuSplatSource.fromPackedSplats(device, packed); // source.attribs
```

The WASM decoder reads the extra properties itself (`rust/spark-lib/src/ply.rs`). With an older WASM build that doesn't, `PlyAttributeReader` reads them from the same byte stream in the loader worker, with the same grouping rules.

### .rad

A `.rad` file lists its attribute schema in its metadata (`attributes: [{ name, format, components, lodMerge }]`), and each chunk stores every attribute as an `attrib` property named after it, in its own format (`f32`, `f16`, `r8` for `unorm8`, `s8` for `snorm8`, `u32` for the integer formats), gzip-compressed. `build-lod` writes the attributes of a PLY into the `.rad` it builds. A `.rad` loaded as PackedSplats or ExtSplats carries them in `extra.attribs`.

A `.rad` file doesn't store the `direction` flag: a 3-component attribute with `normalizeMean` is read back as a direction. Files with attributes need a decoder that knows the `attrib` property; older ones reject it.

Paged `.rad` streaming (`PagedSplats` through `WgpuLod`) pages attributes with the splats: `WgpuSplatPager` keeps a third pool (`PagedAttribPool`) in the pool layout over all pages, with the schema from the `.rad` metadata (or the first chunk), and writes each chunk's attributes at its page base, converted to the schema's formats. `SplatAttributes` binds that pool directly instead of uploading it.

## LoD merge rules

When a LoD tree is built (`lod: true`, or `build-lod` for `.rad`), each parent splat merges its children, and each attribute is merged by its `lodMerge` rule with the same normalized weights the splat merge uses (area × opacity):

| Rule | Parent value |
| ---- | ------------ |
| `weightedMean` | the weighted mean of each component |
| `normalizeMean` | the weighted mean, renormalized to unit length. Children are first flipped into the heaviest child's hemisphere, since a splat's normal has no inside or outside |
| `max` | the maximum of each component |
| `mode` | the whole value with the largest total weight (labels); ties go to the earliest child |
| `first` | the first child's value |

Values are merged as `f64`, so integer labels and ids up to 2<sup>53</sup> merge exactly. The tiny, Bhattacharyya and quick LoD builders all carry attributes. The LoD splats of a PackedSplats or ExtSplats built with `lod: true` carry the merged attributes in `lodSplats.extra.attribs`, and `WgpuLod` draws them with their LoD indices.

## Reading attributes in Slang

On the GPU an attribute pool is one `uint` buffer that carries its own descriptor table, so one compiled kernel serves every schema:

```
[0] strideWords  [1] numAttribs  [2] headerWords  [3] count (splats)
[4 + 4k ..]      attribute k: offsetWords, format, components, flags
[headerWords + splat * strideWords + offsetWords ..]  attribute k's data
```

`AttribPool.pack()` builds it, and `slang/core/attrib.slang` reads it:

```hlsl
import core.attrib;

StructuredBuffer<uint> attribs;

// Components 4·comp4 .. 4·comp4 + 3 of attribute `id` of `splat`, as floats
// (missing components are 0).
float4 feature = readAttrib(attribs, featureId, splat, 1u);
// One component's stored bits: for u8, u16 and u32 the integer, exactly.
uint label = readAttribU(attribs, labelId, splat, 0u);
```

`writeAttrib` writes into a `RWStructuredBuffer<uint>` pool, and `attribDesc`, `attribCount` and `attribSplats` read the table. Attribute ids are resolved by name on the host: `AttribPool.id(name)` for a source pool, `SplatAttributes.drawId(name)` for the draw pool. Integer formats come back from `readAttrib` as floats of their values; use `readAttribU` for labels and ids beyond 2<sup>24</sup>. An unknown id reads as zeros.

## Drawing and picking

`SplatAttributes` (`src/webgpu/attributes/SplatAttributes.ts`) adds attributes to a `WgpuSplatRenderer`:

- After generate, `slang/kernels/attrib_gather.slang` copies every mesh's `toDraw` attributes into a **draw pool** indexed like the accumulator. Its schema is the union of the meshes' `toDraw` attributes (the first mesh with a name sets its format); a mesh without one gets zeros. It follows the mesh's LoD indices, converts formats where they differ, and turns direction attributes into world space.
- The draw uses `slang/draw/splat_attrib_draw.slang`, which reads up to four **slots** of four components each into flat varyings. Colour modes use them: `splat` (the splat's own colour), `label` (a palette by the integer in `colorSlot`, with an optional `highlight`), `relight` (Lambert lighting with `colorSlot` as the normal), `project` (`rgb = offset + rows · (slot, slot + 1)`, for feature vectors) and `value` (the slot as a colour).
- Extra render targets (multiple render targets in one pass): `id`, an `rgba8unorm` target holding the front-most splat whose alpha reaches `pickAlpha`, and `slot0` / `slot1`, `rgba16float` targets with slots 0 and 1 alpha-composited like the colour.

`pick(x, y)` reads the id target at a pixel of the last frame and returns the mesh, the source splat index (through its LoD indices) and the accumulator slot, or `null`.

`SplatAttributes` works with `WgpuSplatRenderer.render()`, which opens its own render pass. `SparkRenderer` on WebGPU draws in three's pass and doesn't use it.

## Example

Six labelled shapes whose splats carry a normal, a label and an 8-component feature, coloured by label and picked by clicking (from `examples/webgpu/attributes.html`):

```typescript
import * as THREE from "three/webgpu";
import { GpuSplatSource, SplatAttributes, WgpuSplatRenderer } from "@sparkjsdev/spark/webgpu";

const renderer = new THREE.WebGPURenderer();
await renderer.init();
const splats = new WgpuSplatRenderer(renderer);
const attributes = new SplatAttributes(splats, {
  // Slot 0: label, 1: normal, 2-3: the feature's two groups of four.
  slots: ["label", "normal", { name: "feature", comp4: 0 }, { name: "feature", comp4: 1 }],
  colorMode: "label",
  colorSlot: 0,
  targets: { id: true },
});

const source = GpuSplatSource.fromExt(splats.device, extA, extB, count);
source.setAttribute("normal", normals, "snorm8", 3, { toDraw: true, direction: true });
source.setAttribute("label", labels, "u8", 1, { toDraw: true });
source.setAttribute("feature", features, "f16", 8, { toDraw: true });
splats.add(source, new THREE.Object3D());

// Relight by the normal in slot 1 instead:
// Object.assign(attributes.options, { colorMode: "relight", colorSlot: 1 });

renderer.domElement.addEventListener("click", async (event) => {
  const ratio = renderer.getPixelRatio();
  const hit = await attributes.pick(event.offsetX * ratio, event.offsetY * ratio);
  if (hit) {
    const [label] = hit.mesh.source.attribs.getAttribute("label", hit.index);
    attributes.options.highlight = label;
  }
});

renderer.setAnimationLoop(() => {
  renderer.setRenderTarget(target);   // a RenderTarget with a DepthTexture
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
  splats.render(camera, target);
  renderer.setRenderTarget(null);
  output.render(renderer);            // a QuadMesh showing target.texture
});
```

With `?source=ply` the example writes the same scene as a PLY with `nx`/`ny`/`nz`, `label` and `feature_0`..`feature_7` properties and loads it through `PackedSplats`, which gives the same attributes from the file.
